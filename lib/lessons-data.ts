  Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It's designed to be simple and easy to read.
  
  Some cool facts about Python:
  - It's named after the comedy group Monty Python, not the snake!
  - Many big companies like Google, Netflix, and NASA use Python
  - Python can be used for websites, games, data science, and much more

  Variables are like containers that store data. You can think of them as labeled boxes that hold values.
  
  In Python, you create a variable by giving it a name and assigning a value with the equals sign (\`=\`).
  
  For example:
  
  \`\`\`python
  age = 10
  name = "Alex"
  \`\`\`
  
  Variables are super useful because you can use them, change them, and refer to them throughout your code!`,

  There are two main types of numbers:
  - Integers (whole numbers like 5, 42, -10)
  - Floating point numbers (decimal numbers like 3.14, 2.5, -0.5)
  
  Let's create variables with numbers:

  You can use either single quotes (') or double quotes (") for strings.
  
  You can join strings together using the + operator:
  
  \`\`\`python
  first_name = "Alex"
  last_name = "Smith"
  full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
  print(full_name)  # Prints: Alex Smith

  age_text = input("How old are you? ")

  years_to_100 = 100 - age

    title: 'Introduction to Lists',
    content: `# Lists in Python

So far, we've used variables to store single values like numbers or strings. But what if you want to store multiple values?

In Python, a list is an ordered collection of items. Lists can contain any type of data, including numbers, strings, or even other lists.

Here's how to create a list:

\`\`\`python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
\`\`\`

Lists are written with square brackets, and items are separated by commas.`,

  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Accessing List Items',
    content: `# Accessing Items in a List

You can access list items by their index (position). In Python, indices start at 0:

\`\`\`python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(fruits[0])  # Prints "apple" (first item)
print(fruits[1])  # Prints "banana" (second item)
print(fruits[2])  # Prints "cherry" (third item)
\`\`\`

You can also use negative indices to access items from the end:

\`\`\`python
print(fruits[-1])  # Prints "cherry" (last item)
print(fruits[-2])  # Prints "banana" (second-to-last item)
\`\`\`

Let's try accessing items in a list:`,
    type: 'code',
    codeTemplate: 'fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]\n\n# Print the first item\nprint(fruits[0])\n\n# Print the third item\nprint(fruits[2])\n\n# Print the last item\nprint(fruits[-1])\n\n# Print the second-to-last item\nprint(fruits[-2])',

    title: 'Modifying Lists',
    content: `# Changing List Items

Unlike strings, lists are mutable, which means you can change their content:

\`\`\`python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Change the second item
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
print(fruits)  # Prints ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry"]
\`\`\`

You can also add items to a list using the \`append()\` method:

\`\`\`python
fruits.append("dragonfruit")
print(fruits)  # Prints ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry", "dragonfruit"]
\`\`\`

And remove items using \`remove()\`:

\`\`\`python
fruits.remove("cherry")
print(fruits)  # Prints ["apple", "blueberry", "dragonfruit"]
\`\`\`

Let's practice modifying lists:`,
    type: 'code',
    codeTemplate: 'fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]\n\n# Change the second item to "blueberry"\nfruits[1] = "blueberry"\nprint(fruits)\n\n# Add "dragonfruit" to the end of the list\nfruits.append("dragonfruit")\nprint(fruits)\n\n# Remove "cherry" from the list\nfruits.remove("cherry")\nprint(fruits)',

    title: 'List Operations',
    content: `# Common List Operations

Python provides many useful operations for working with lists:

\`\`\`python
# List Length
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(fruits))  # Prints 3

# Checking if an item exists
print("banana" in fruits)  # Prints True
print("mango" in fruits)   # Prints False

# Finding the index of an item
print(fruits.index("cherry"))  # Prints 2

# Counting occurrences of an item
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4]
print(numbers.count(2))  # Prints 3

# Sorting a list
fruits.sort()
print(fruits)  # Prints ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] (alphabetical order)

# Reversing a list
fruits.reverse()
print(fruits)  # Prints ["cherry", "banana", "apple"] (reversed)
\`\`\`

Let's try some list operations:`,
    type: 'code',
    codeTemplate: 'fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"]\n\n# Print the length of the list\nprint("Length:", len(fruits))\n\n# Check if "banana" is in the list\nprint("Is banana in the list?", "banana" in fruits)\n\n# Count how many times "apple" appears\nprint("Apple count:", fruits.count("apple"))\n\n# Sort the list\nfruits.sort()\nprint("Sorted list:", fruits)\n\n# Reverse the list\nfruits.reverse()\nprint("Reversed list:", fruits)',

  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: 'Looping Through Lists',
    content: `# Using For Loops with Lists

One of the most common operations is to iterate through all items in a list using a for loop:

\`\`\`python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
print(fruit)
\`\`\`

This will print each fruit on a new line.

You can also use the \`enumerate()\` function to get both the index and value:

\`\`\`python
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
\`\`\`

Let's practice looping through lists:`,

    title: 'Introduction to Dictionaries',
    content: `# Dictionaries in Python

While lists store items in a specific order, dictionaries store data as key-value pairs.

Think of a dictionary like a real-world dictionary: you look up a word (the key) to find its definition (the value).

Here's how to create a dictionary:

\`\`\`python
student = {
    "name": "Alex",
    "age": 15,
    "grade": 9,
    "subjects": ["Math", "Science", "History"]
}
\`\`\`

Dictionaries are written with curly braces. Each key-value pair is separated by a colon, and pairs are separated by commas.

Keys must be unique and immutable (like strings, numbers, or tuples), but values can be any data type (even lists or other dictionaries).`,

    animation: 'slide-in-left'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Accessing Dictionary Values',

You can access dictionary values by referring to their keys:

\`\`\`python
student = {
    "name": "Alex",
    "age": 15,
    "grade": 9
}

print(student["name"])  # Prints "Alex"
print(student["age"])   # Prints 15
\`\`\`

You can also use the \`get()\` method, which has the advantage of not raising an error if the key doesn't exist:

\`\`\`python
print(student.get("name"))  # Prints "Alex"
print(student.get("phone"))  # Prints None (since "phone" doesn't exist)
print(student.get("phone", "Not available"))  # Prints "Not available" (default value)

    "grade": 9
}

# Change a value
student["age"] = 16

# Add a new key-value pair
student["phone"] = "555-1234"
print(student)  # Now has a phone key

# Remove a key-value pair
del student["grade"]
print(student)  # No longer has a grade key

      title: 'Introduction to Functions',
      content: `# Functions in Python

So far, we've been writing code that runs line by line from top to bottom. But as programs get larger, we need a way to organize our code into reusable pieces.

That's where functions come in. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused throughout your program.

Here's the basic syntax for defining a function:

\`\`\`python
def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body (code to run)
    # ...
    return result  # Optional return value
\`\`\`

The \`def\` keyword tells Python you're defining a function. The function name should describe what the function does.`,
      type: 'explanation',
      animation: 'slide-in-left'
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'Creating Simple Functions',
      content: `# Creating Your First Function

Let's create a simple function that greets someone:

\`\`\`python
def greet(name):
    message = f"Hello, {name}!"
    return message

# Call the function
greeting = greet("Alex")
print(greeting)  # Prints "Hello, Alex!"

# Call it again with a different argument
print(greet("Sam"))  # Prints "Hello, Sam!"
\`\`\`

Notice:
1. We define the function with \`def greet(name):\`
2. The function takes one parameter: \`name\`
3. The function returns a message using \`return\`
4. We call the function by writing \`greet("Alex")\`

Let's create some simple functions:`,
      type: 'code',
      codeTemplate: '# Define a function that greets someone\ndef greet(name):\n    message = f"Hello, {name}!"\n    return message\n\n# Call the function with different names\nprint(greet("Alex"))\nprint(greet("Sam"))\n\n# Define a function that squares a number\ndef square(number):\n    return number ** 2\n\n# Call the square function\nprint(square(4))  # Should print 16\nprint(square(5))  # Should print 25',
      animation: 'fade-in'
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      title: 'Function Parameters',
      content: `# Working with Function Parameters

Functions can take multiple parameters (inputs):

\`\`\`python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Prints 8
\`\`\`

You can also provide default values for parameters:

\`\`\`python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

print(greet("Alex"))             # Prints "Hello, Alex!"
print(greet("Sam", "Hi there"))  # Prints "Hi there, Sam!"
\`\`\`

Parameters with default values are optional - if you don't provide them, the default is used.

Let's practice creating functions with parameters:`,
      type: 'code',
      codeTemplate: '# Function with multiple parameters\ndef calculate_total(price, tax_rate):\n    tax = price * tax_rate\n    total = price + tax\n    return total\n\n# Call the function\nprint(calculate_total(100, 0.05))  # Price of 100 with 5% tax\n\n# Function with default parameter\ndef greet(name, greeting="Hello"):\n    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"\n\n# Call with and without the optional parameter\nprint(greet("Alex"))             # Using default greeting\nprint(greet("Sam", "Hi there"))  # Providing a custom greeting',
      animation: 'slide-in-right'
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      title: 'Return Values',
      content: `# Understanding Return Values

Functions can return values that you can use elsewhere in your code:

\`\`\`python
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

result = multiply(4, 5)
print(result)  # Prints 20
print(multiply(3, 7))  # Prints 21
\`\`\`

Functions can return different values based on conditions:

\`\`\`python
def get_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

print(get_grade(85))  # Prints "B"
print(get_grade(72))  # Prints "C"
\`\`\`

A function ends as soon as it hits a \`return\` statement.

Let's practice with return values:`,
      type: 'code',
      codeTemplate: '# Function that returns a value\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\n# Store the result in a variable\nresult = multiply(4, 5)\nprint(result)\n\n# Function that returns different values based on conditions\ndef get_letter_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return "A"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return "B"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return "C"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return "D"\n    else:\n        return "F"\n\n# Test the function\nprint(get_letter_grade(95))  # Should print "A"\nprint(get_letter_grade(81))  # Should print "B"\nprint(get_letter_grade(65))  # Should print "D"',
      animation: 'bounce'
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      title: 'Functions Without Return',
      content: `# Functions That Don't Return Values

Not all functions need to return values. Some functions just perform actions:

\`\`\`python
def print_header(text):
    print("=" * 30)
    print(text)
    print("=" * 30)

print_header("WELCOME")
\`\`\`

This function doesn't return anythingâ€”it just prints a formatted header.

If a function doesn't have a \`return\` statement, it implicitly returns \`None\`:

\`\`\`python
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

result = say_hello("Alex")
print(result)  # Prints None
\`\`\`

Let's create some functions that don't return values:`,
      type: 'code',
      codeTemplate: '# Function that just prints a formatted message\ndef print_header(text):\n    print("=" * 30)\n    print(text.center(30))\n    print("=" * 30)\n\n# Call the function\nprint_header("WELCOME")\nprint_header("PYTHON FUNCTIONS")\n\n# Function that prints a countdown\ndef countdown(n):\n    print("Starting countdown...")\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        print(i)\n    print("Blast off!")\n\n# Call the function\ncountdown(5)',
      animation: 'fade-in'
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      title: 'Combining Functions',
      content: `# Using Functions with Other Functions

One of the great benefits of functions is that they can use other functions:

\`\`\`python
def get_first_name():
    return input("Enter your first name: ")

def get_last_name():
    return input("Enter your last name: ")

def greet_user():
    first = get_first_name()
    last = get_last_name()
    print(f"Hello, {first} {last}!")

greet_user()
\`\`\`

This makes your code more organized and easier to understand.

Let's practice combining functions:`,
      type: 'code',
      codeTemplate: '# Function to calculate the area of a circle\ndef calculate_area(radius):\n    import math\n    return math.pi * radius ** 2\n\n# Function to calculate the circumference of a circle\ndef calculate_circumference(radius):\n    import math\n    return 2 * math.pi * radius\n\n# Function that uses both functions above\ndef display_circle_info(radius):\n    area = calculate_area(radius)\n    circumference = calculate_circumference(radius)\n    \n    print(f"Circle with radius {radius}:")\n    print(f"Area: {area:.2f} square units")\n    print(f"Circumference: {circumference:.2f} units")\n\n# Call the combined function\ndisplay_circle_info(5)\nprint()\ndisplay_circle_info(7.5)',
